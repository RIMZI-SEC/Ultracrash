# 💣 RIMZI-HYPER-XCRASHER

**The most extreme WhatsApp group crash tool ever built — coded by Rimzi 💀**  
This tool generates a **1GB+ invisible Unicode payload** in a **2-line visible message** that causes WhatsApp to freeze, lag, or crash on any device — including 6GB–16GB RAM phones.

## 📦 How it Works

| Layer                    | Impact                                |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 🔕 Invisible Unicode      | Hidden overload to crash message render
| 🔁 Bidi + RTL             | Breaks alignment & UI internally
| 🧬 Surrogate Exploits     | Crashes font parser engine
| 🕵️‍♂️ Math control marks   | Memory spike when scrolling or replying
